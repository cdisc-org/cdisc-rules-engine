## Dataset

Report one result per dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where a dataset or record within the dataset matches the rule failure criteria

## Record

Report one result per record within the dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where the record matches the rule failure criteria

## Group

Report one result per logical group of records within the dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where the group matches the rule failure criteria. Groups are defined by the `Grouping_Variables` specified in the rule. This sensitivity level requires `Grouping_Variables` to be specified and provides a middle ground between Dataset (too few reports) and Record (too many reports) sensitivity levels.

### Example

```yaml
Sensitivity: Group
Grouping_Variables:
  - SETCD
```
