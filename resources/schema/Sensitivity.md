## Dataset

Report one result per dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where a dataset or record within the dataset matches the rule failure criteria

## Record

Report one result per record within the dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where the record matches the rule failure criteria

## Group

Reports one issue per each logical group of records within the dataset generated by the `Rule Type`, where the group matches the rule failure criteria. Records are organized into logical groups based on matching values for the `Grouping_Variables` specified in the rule (e.g., records with the same `SETCD` value form one group). For each group that violates the rule, the engine reports a single error using the first record from that group that matches the failure criteria. Groups are defined by the `Grouping_Variables` specified in the rule. This sensitivity level requires `Grouping_Variables` to be specified.

### Example

```yaml
Sensitivity: Group
Grouping Variables:
  - SETCD
```
